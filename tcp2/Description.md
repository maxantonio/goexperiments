1.00 tcp server with RCP

the tcp server eventually is going to run permanently as a daemon (only for your information)
The tcp server is going to interact with two clients client A and Client B
the client A is only going to send messages
the client B is going to interact with a few methods and values of the server. (rcp)
So I think that you should
Define the tcp port in a variable
Create a function  "start_time" that returns at what time the server started working
Create a function "number_messages" that returns the number of messages that the server has received for the client A.

So when running the client B, we should be able to get from the server the value of start_time and number_messages
